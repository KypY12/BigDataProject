# Big Data Project - Dat.P10 - Advanced graph-based analysis

Take citation and co-authorship graphs as input (but not only!) in order to:

1. Look for collaboration islands - see what researchers are more likely to collaborate with each other (co-authorship). Is it influenced by research field, locations, affiliations, funding/grants?
2. <s>Analyze how research ideas are spreading through space and time.</s>
3. <s>Look for emerging research fields and make forecasts for their influence within the research domain based on history, funding, and affiliation (location) information.</s>
4. Check for rising stars (authors with high growth in number of publications)
