# Big Data Project - Dat.P10 - Advanced graph-based analysis

Take citation and co-authorship graphs as input (but not only!) in order to:

\t a) Look for collaboration islands - see what researchers are more likely to collaborate with each other (co-authorship). Is it influenced by research field, locations, affiliations, funding/grants?

\t b) Analyze how research ideas are spreading through space and time.

\t c) Look for emerging research fields and make forecasts for their influence within the research domain based on history, funding, and affiliation (location) information.

\t d) Check for rising stars (authors with high growth in number of publications)
